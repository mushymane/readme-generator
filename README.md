# Readme Generator
![license badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-ISC-orange)
## Description 

This command line app generates a professional README.md for your project.
It will prompt for the title of your project, a description, installation instructions, how to use it, 
guidelines for contributions, testing and examples, your Github username and an email one can contact you.

It uses the npm Inquirer package to ask questions and receive input. It also uses the Node File System module 
to write that data to a file. There is a file called generateMarkdown.js which generates the entire 
readme file using the user's input and template literals. In this same file it generates a license badge, and 
license links.
